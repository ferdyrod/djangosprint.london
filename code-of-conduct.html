          Django Sprint London is a community event. We value the participation of each member
          of the Django community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable experience.
          All attendees - delegates, speakers, volunteers, sponsors and organisers - are expected
           to abide by this Code of Conduct. If necessary, the organisers will act to enforce it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>TL;DR: Don't be a Jerk. Be excellent.</strong></p>

        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          All attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          All communication should be appropriate for a general audience, which may include children
          and people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Django Sprint London will not tolerate harassment in any form, or language, imagery or behaviour that are:
        <ul>
          <li>sexist, racist or exclusionary</li>
          <li>intimidating or threatening</li>
          <li>insulting or unpleasant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Harassment can include: offensive verbal comments related to sex or gender, sexual orientation,
          disability, appearance, body size, race, religion; the use of sexual images; deliberate intimidation,
          stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
          inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alcohol overdose does not relieve anyone of the responsibility for their actions.
        </p>

        <h2>If there is a problem</h2>
        <p>
          If you are troubled by the behaviour of another attendee at the event, or are concerned that another
           attendee may be in distress, please speak immediately to any member of the staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your concern will be heard in confidence, taken seriously, and dealt with according to a documented procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Event staff - volunteers and organisers - will be on hand throughout the event. Any concern, whatever it is,
          will be immediately dealt with. The organizers will investigate promptly and if necessary will take appropriate action.
          This may include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              asking a violator to stop their behaviour and issuing a warning
            </li>
            <li>
              asking a violator of the Code of Conduct to leave the leave the event immediately
            </li>
            <li>
              passing on details of the incident to the Django Software Foundation and/or Python Software Foundation
            </li>
            <li>
              informing the police about the incident
            </li>
          </ul>
